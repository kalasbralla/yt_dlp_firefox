## Snap/flatpak permissions

In case of web browser installed via snap/flatpak there might be a problem with accessing resources outside of sandbox. If you won't be asked for permissions you can add them using command line via following command:

```
flatpak permission-set webextensions yt_dlp_firefox snap.firefox yes
```

To check current permissions:

```
flatpak permission-show snap.firefox
```

you should see following:

| Table            | Object            | App          | Permissions  | Data |
| :--------------- |:----------------- | :----------- | :----------- | :--- |
| webextensions    | yt_dlp_firefox    | snap.firefox | yes          | 0x00 |


to debug issues in snap/flatpak permissions start browser like this:

```
